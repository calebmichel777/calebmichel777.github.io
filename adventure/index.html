We first had to find lockers to store all our belongings in at the park, after that we got our wristbands and were to do whatever in the park. 2 of my brothers went on the roller coasters but the rest of my brothers went to go get food. Eventually we went on the rollercoasters and had a fun first day.</h3></li>

</p></i><h3 style="color:rgb(183, 0, 255)">This was our second &#38; final day at the Cedar Park. We did most of the same on this day. We tried more rollercoasters, played games, got food. One notable thing was we played a game where you have to knock bottles down wih a ball and if you get them all, you'd get the grand prize which was a really big stuffed animal. I won, and got a big Squirtle from Pokemon plush, which I still own to this day. Then we had to leave back to our home in Wiscosnin.</h3> <img src="Cedar Point.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="300">

</p></i><h3 style="color:rgb(183, 0, 255)">This was just us on the road driving back home. Nothing much notable happened. Got food every now and then. Got back to our house later that night.</h3>
