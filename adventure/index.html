</h1>August 10th, 2016</h2>

</p> After a couple days on the road in Ohio, my family eventually arrived at Cedar Point. We first had to find lockers to store all our belongings in at the park, after that we got our wristbands and were to do whatever in the park. 2 of my brothers went on the roller coasters but the rest of my brothers went to go get food. Eventually we went on the rollercoasters and had a fun first day. </p>

</p>This was our second and final day at the park. We did most of the same on this day. We tried more rollercoasters, played games, got food. One notable thing was we played a game where you have to knock bottles down wih a ball and if you get them all, you'd get the grand prize which was a really big stuffed animal. I won, and got a big Squirtle from Pokemon plush, which I still own to this day. Then we had to leave back to our home in Wiscosnin.</p>

</p>This was just us on the road driving back home. Nothing much notable happened. Got food every now and then. Got back to our house later that night. </p>
